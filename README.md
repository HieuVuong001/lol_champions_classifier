# LoL Champions Classifier
An attempt to classify 166 unique champions from the game League of Legends using Deep Learning.

Although the result is modest (~73%) on the test set, it is a good learning experience. 

Several approaches are tried including using baseline simple Convolutional Neural Network and fine tuning on ResNet model with pre-trained weights.

The model does relatively well on official splash arts and models

but not so well on images on the internet.

Hoping to improve this further in the future as my skill set grows.
